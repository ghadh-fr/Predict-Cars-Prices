Web Scraping/Linear Regression

Data Description:
Using cars.com dataset. The focus is on Audi cars. Using Python library Beautiful Soup to scrape the cars information. The dataset contained about 6 features: description, dealer, miles of driving, rate, number of reviews, and price.

Tools:
The tool that we need is Pandas packages to manipulate data, BeautifulSoap to scrape data, LinearRegression from the sklearn.linear_model class of the sklearn module to perform the linear regression then predicted the number of days, Scikit Learn Framework and visualization library (such as Seaborn and Matplotlib), Metrics library to see the model performance on data, and Jupyter notebook to execute the code. till now we are not planning to use any additional tools.
